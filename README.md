# Filament Error Mailer üö®

Filament plugin for instant e-mail alerts on web errors, simplifying monitoring and application stability.

## Features

### Instant Error Notifications

Sends error details instantly via email with all relevant context, including:

- Error message, file, and line number.
- Request details: method, IP, user agent, referrer, request time, and URI.
- Authenticated user details (if available).

### Discord Webhook Integration

In addition to email notifications, you can configure a Discord webhook to send error alerts directly to a Discord channel.
The webhook includes:
- Error message, file, and line number.
- A clickable link to view detailed error information in your application.

To enable this, set the `ERROR_MAILER_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` environment variable in your `.env` file with your Discord webhook URL.
```
ERROR_MAILER_DISCORD_WEBHOOK="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-id/your-webhook-token"
```

### Error Details Page

Each error notification includes a unique link to a dedicated error details page in your application.  
The page displays:
- Full error context (file, line, message).
- Request details (method, IP, user agent, referrer, time, URI).
- Full stack trace for debugging.
- Authenticated user information (if available).

### Error Notification Cooldown

- Avoids spamming your inbox or webhook by setting a cooldown period (cacheCooldown) in minutes.
- During this period, duplicate errors will not trigger new notifications.

### Scheduled Cleanup (Optional)

To prevent excessive storage, you can schedule a cleanup task to remove old errors.  
Example:
```php
$schedule->call(function () {
    $storagePath = config('error-mailer.storage_path');
    $files = File::files($storagePath);

    foreach ($files as $file) {
        if ($file->getMTime() < now()->subMonths(3)->timestamp) {
            File::delete($file->getRealPath());
        }
    }
})->daily();
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require hugomyb/filament-error-mailer
```

Then, publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="error-mailer-config"
```

This will create a `config/error-mailer.php` file in your Laravel project.

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    'email' => [
        'recipient' => ['recipient1@example.com'],
        'bcc' => [],
        'cc' => [],
        'subject' => 'An error has occurred - ' . env('APP_NAME'),
    ],

    'disabledOn' => [
        //
    ],

    'cacheCooldown' => 10, // in minutes

    'webhooks' => [
        'discord' => env('ERROR_MAILER_DISCORD_WEBHOOK'),

        'message' => [
            'title' => 'Error Alert - ' . env('APP_NAME'),
            'description' => 'An error has occured in the application.',
            'error' => 'Error',
            'file' => 'File',
            'line' => 'Line',
            'details_link' => 'See more details'
        ],
    ],
    
    'storage_path' => storage_path('app/errors'),
];
```

Optionally, you can publish views using:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="error-mailer-views"
```

## Configuration

After publishing the configuration file, you can modify it to suit your needs. Open `config/error-mailer.php` and
customize the following options:

- `'recipient'`: Set email addresses where error notifications will be sent.

- `'bcc'`: Set email addresses where error notifications will be sent in BCC.

- `'cc'`: Set email addresses where error notifications will be sent in CC.

- `'subject'`: Define the subject line for error notification emails. You can use placeholders like `env('APP_NAME')` to
dynamically include your application's name.

- `'cacheCooldown'`: Set the cooling-off period (in minutes) for error notifications. If the same error occurs several times within this period

- `'disabledOn'`: You can specify a list of environments (based on `APP_ENV`) where the Error Mailer will be disabled.
For example, if you want to disable the mailer in the local environment, add 'local' to the array:

```php
'disabledOn' => [
    'local',
],
```

- `'webhooks'`: Add a Discord webhook URL and customize the webhook message fields.
- `'storage_path'`: Define the directory where JSON error files will be stored. Defaults to `storage/app/errors`.

<hr/>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT ! Make sure to configure a mail server in your `.env` file :**

```sh
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=your-smtp-host.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-smtp-username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
```

If the mail server is not configured in the `.env` file, email notifications will not be sent.

Finally, don't forget to register the plugin in your `AdminPanelProvider`:

```php
...
->plugins([
    FilamentErrorMailerPlugin::make()
])
```
